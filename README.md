# Battery Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction

End-to-end ML pipeline for battery RUL prediction using cycle-level features,
a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for health embeddings, and an LSTM for temporal modeling.

Focuses on battery-wise temporal evaluation (smoothness and monotonicity),
not just pointwise accuracy.
